# Gilded Rose Program
This is a simple program that will update the Quality and SellIn values of all items sold by the Gilded Rose !

## How to build/Run the program
The simpliest way to build and run this example program is to open the .csproj inside Visual Studio and then run in debug/release the project.

You can of course build the project by using:
```
$ dotnet build csharpcore.csproj
```

and then you can run the .dll program by using:
```
$ dotnet bin/Debug/netcoreapp2.1/csharpcore.dll
```
Where the .dll path is actually the path given as a result of the *dotnet build* command.
